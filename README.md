# String Calculator Kata Example

This repo contains a commit by commit solution to Roy Osherove's String Calculator Kata.  The step by step guide to completing the Kata can be found [here](http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/)

The solution here is aimed at .Net developers.  It is written in C# and compiles with any modern version of Visual Studio using .Net Framework 4.6.1.  It's supporting tests are written using MS Test to make running the solution very easy.

## Supporting post

This repo was created to support a blog post I authored which is located [here](https://www.amcrou.ch/string-calculator-kata-dotnet).

As I cover in the blog post, this solution was completed a step at a time and then committed. This was to allow someone to read back through the commit log to see the steps and tests I completed.  The post and repo were inspired when using the Kata as a teaching tool with a recent junior hire.

I do not suggest this is the best solution to the problem and I welcome any feedback.
